    <h1>Angela's Awesome Enchiladas </h1>

<body>
    <p>The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I whipped these up on my own using ingredients I had on hand. 
        Shredding the chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in the end. 
        Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2
          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, 
            and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.</p>
          <h3>Step 2</h3> 
          <p>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred chicken with two forks.</p>
          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <P>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.</P>
          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.</p>
          <h3>Step 5</h3>
          <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
          <h3>Step 6</h3>
          <p>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
          <h3>Step 7</h3>
          <p>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.</p>
          <h3>Step 8</h3>
          <p>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.</p>
          <h3>Step 9</h3>
          <p>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
